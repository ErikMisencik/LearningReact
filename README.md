# React Frontend Learning Repo

This repository is a personal learning space dedicated to improving my frontend development skills using **React** and **Vite**. Coming from a backend-heavy background with **Java**, this project serves as a playground to get hands-on experience with modern frontend technologies, UI development, and state management in React.

## Purpose

- Explore React fundamentals and ecosystem
- Understand component-based architecture
- Practice frontend best practices and patterns
- Complement backend skills with full-stack capabilities

## Tech Stack

- **React** – Core library for building user interfaces
- **Vite** – Fast build tool and development server for React apps

Feel free to explore the code, experiments, and small demos throughout the project as I progressively deepen my understanding of the frontend side of web development.
